# April Rivenend's Expanded Tooltips
A bunch of item tooltips and loading screen tips intended for Cloverfield Origins, a private friends-only Minecraft SMP. On 1.21.x, there are more general descriptions.  
This resource pack is tested with 1.20.1, but other versions may work.

Anglish containes english tooltips that I wrote while stoned. I didn't want to fit it anywhere else. It seemed offensive.

- US English (for generic tooltips)
